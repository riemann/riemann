    <p>Riemann aggregates events from your servers and applications with a
    powerful stream processing language. Send an email for every exception in
    your app. Track the latency distribution of your web app.  See the top
    processes on any host, by memory and CPU. Combine statistics from every
    Riak node in your cluster and forward to Graphite. Track user activity from
    second to second.</p>

    <p class="callout">Riemann provides <i class="focus">low-latency,
      transient shared state</i> for systems with many moving parts.</p>

      <p>Riemann streams are just functions which accept an event. Events are
      just structs with some common fields like <code>:host</code> and
      <code>:service</code> You can use dozens of built-in streams for <a
        href="/howto.html#working-with-streams">filtering, altering, and
        combining events</a>, or write your own.</p>

      <p>Since Riemann's configuration is a <i>Clojure program</i>, its syntax
      is concise, regular, and extendable. Configuration-as-code minimizes
      boilerplate and gives you the flexibility to adapt to complex
      situations.</p>

      <p>I wrote Riemann for operations staff trying to keep a large, dynamic
      infrastructure running with unreliable but fault-tolerant components. For
      engineers who need to understand the source of errors and performance
      bottlenecks in production. For everyone fed up with traditional
      approaches; who want something fast, expressive, and powerful.</p>

      <p>Riemann can tell you as much or as little as you want. Throttle or
      roll up multiple events into a single messages. Get emails about
      exceptions in your code, provider downtime, or latency spikes. You can
      also integrate with <a href="https://github.com/riemann/riemann/blob/master/src/riemann/pagerduty.clj">PagerDuty</a> for SMS or phone alerts.</p>

      <p>Riemann speaks <a href="http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/">Protocol

      <p>Search the Riemann index with a small query language. Clients can
      monitor each other, generate reports, or render dashboards.</p>

      <p>Riemann queries form the basis for the realtime websockets
      dashboard, showing updated events as soon as they arrive.</p>

      <h2>See problems faster</h2>

      <p>Traditional monitoring systems run polling loops every five minutes,
      or roll up metrics on a minutely basis. In a Riemann infrastructure,
      clients (including stand-alone pollers) *push* their events to Riemann,
      which makes them visible within milliseconds. Low latencies let you see
      outages faster--and know the instant you've fixed the problem.</p>

      <p>Throughput depends on what your streams *do* with events, but a stock
      Riemann config on commodity x86 hardware can handle *millions* of events
      per second at sub-ms latencies, with 99ths around 5ms. Riemann is fully
      parallel and leverages Clojure and JVM concurrency primitives
      throughout.</p>

      <h2>Brought to you by&hellip;</h2>

      <p>Riemann was made possible by the <a href="/thanks.html">hard work</a>
        of many open-source contributors. Everyone who's offered advice, asked
        questions, and submitted code has my deepest appreciation.</p>

      <p>I wrote Riemann to help solve problems at work: both <a
        href="http://showyou.com">Showyou</a> and <a
        href="http://boundary.com">Boundary</a> deserve thanks for letting me
      build this crazy thing and share it with the world. <a

      Metrics integration. <a href="https://www.bluemountaincapital.com/">Blue
