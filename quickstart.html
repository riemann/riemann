      <h2>Installing Riemann</h2>

      <p>Riemann's components are all configured to work out-of-the-box on
      localhost, and this quickstart assumes you'll be running everything
      locally. If you're jumping right into running Riemann on multiple nodes,
      check out <a
        href="/howto.html#putting-riemann-into-production">Putting
        Riemann into production</a> for tips.</p>

{% highlight shell_session %}
$ wget https://github.com/riemann/riemann/releases/download/0.2.14/riemann-0.2.14.tar.bz2
$ tar xvfj riemann-0.2.14.tar.bz2
$ cd riemann-0.2.14
{% endhighlight%}

<p>Check the md5sum to verify the tarball:</p>

<code><pre>wget <a href="https://github.com/riemann/riemann/releases/download/0.2.14/riemann-0.2.14.tar.bz2.md5">https://github.com/riemann/riemann/releases/download/0.2.14/riemann-0.2.14.tar.bz2.md5</a>
md5sum -c riemann-0.2.14.tar.bz2.md5
</pre></code>

<p>You can also install Riemann via the Debian or RPM packages, through
      <a href="https://forge.puppetlabs.com/garethr/riemann">Puppet</a>, <a
      href="https://github.com/garethr/riemann-vagrant">Vagrant</a>, or <a
    href="https://github.com/hudl/riemann-cookbook">Chef</a>.</p>

      <p>Start the server</p>

      <code><pre>bin/riemann etc/riemann.config</pre></code>

      <p>Riemann is now listening for events. Install the Ruby client, utility
      package, and dashboard. You may need to install ruby-dev for some
      dependencies; your OS package manager should have a version available for
      your Ruby install.</p>

      <code><pre>gem install riemann-client riemann-tools riemann-dash</pre></code>

      <p>Start the dashboard. If riemann-dash isn't in your path, check your
      rubygems bin directory.</p>

      <code><pre>riemann-dash</pre></code>

      <p>Point your web browser to <a
        href="http://localhost:4567/">http://localhost:4567/</a>. You'll see a
      big title in the top pane and a quick overview of the control scheme in the bottom pane.
      At the top right is the current host your browser is connected to. At the
      top left is the pager, which shows your workspaces--like tabs, in a
      browser.</p>

      <p>Let's change the title into a Grid view. Hold CTRL (or OPTION/META
      depending on your OS) and click the big title "Riemann" in the top pane. The title will be
      shaded grey to indicate that view is selected.</p>

      <p>Then, press "e" to edit, and change "Title" to "Grid". We need to
      choose a <i>query</i> to select specific states from the index. For
      starters, let's select <i>everything</i> by typing <code>true</code> in
      the query field. Hit "Apply" when you're ready.</p>

      <p>This new view is likely a little small, so hit "+" a few times to make
      it bigger. Views are rescaled relative to their neighbors in a
      container.</p>

      <p>Right now the index is empty, so you won't see any events. Let's send
      some:</p>

      <code><pre>riemann-health</pre></code>

      <p>The riemann-health daemon is a little Ruby program that submits events
      about the state of your CPU, memory, load, and disks to a Riemann server.
      If you switch back to the dashboard, you'll see your local host's state
      appear. The Grid view organizes events according to their host and
      service. Color indicates state, and the shaded bars show metrics. You can
      hover over an event, like CPU, to see its description.</p>

      <h2>Working with Clients</h2>

      <p>Now that Riemann is installed, let's try sending some of our own
         states through the Ruby client.</p>

<code><pre><span class="unfocus">$</span> irb -r riemann/client
<span class="unfocus">ruby-1.9.3 :001 &gt;</span> r = Riemann::Client.new
<span class="unfocus"> =&gt; #&lt;Riemann::Client ... &gt;</span></pre></code>

      <p>We can send events with <code>&lt;&lt;</code>. For example, let's log an HTTP request.</p>

    <code><pre><span class="unfocus">ruby-1.9.3 :002 &gt;</span> r &lt;&lt; {
host: "www1",
service: "http req",
metric: 2.53,
state: "critical",
description: "Request took 2.53 seconds.",
tags: ["http"]
}</pre></code>

      <p>On the dashboard, critical events (like the one we just submitted)
      show up in red. All of these fields are optional, by the way. The ruby
      client will assume your events come from the local host name unless you
      pass <code>host: nil</code>.</p>

      <p>Now let's ask for all events that have a service beginning with
      "http".</p>

<code><pre><span class="unfocus">ruby-1.9.3 :003 &gt;</span> r['service =~ "http%"']
<span class="unfocus">[&lt;Riemann::Event time: 1330041937,
state: "critical",
service: "http req",
host: "www1",
description: "Request took 2.53 seconds.",
tags: ["http"],
ttl: 300.0,
metric_f: 2.5299999713897705&gt;]</span></pre></code>

      <p>There's the event we submitted. You could send these events from Rack
      middleware to log every request to your app, or track exceptions. Riemann
      can be configured to calculate rates, averages, min/max, distributions,
      and more.</p>

      <h2>Get started with your own streams</h2>

      <p>A stream is just a function that takes a variable number of child streams and returns a function that takes an event and responds to the event it is passed when it is invoked.</p>

      <p>Streams can modify an event and pass the modified event on to their child streams. Alternatively they can look at the event and choose which of the child streams to pass the event onto, filtering or partitioning the event stream.</p>

      <p>The <code>Riemann/streams</code> namespace provides a number of functions that handle common stream processing tasks.</p>

      <p>By default the Riemann config file contains a stream definition that writes each incoming event into the index. We can create more streams by using the <code>streams</code> function.<p>

      <p>Add the following to the bottom of the <code>riemann.config</code> file:</p>

      {% highlight clj %}
      (streams
        prn)
      {% endhighlight %}

      <p>To test this configuration, reload it and then send an event via the irb shell. The content of the event should be printed in the Riemann log.</p>

      <p>When Riemann receives an event it passes it on to all the streams that are registered. When a stream processes an event it can pass the event, or a modified version of it onto its child streams. Let's modify our code to demonstrate this.</p>

      {% highlight clj %}
      (streams
        prn
        (with {:state "normal"} prn)
        prn)
      {% endhighlight %}

      <p>Now when you submit an event it should get printed three times and you should see that one event has a state of "normal" (the one resulting from the middle stream) and the other two have a state of nil.</p>

      <p>The <code>streams</code> statement adds each stream function to the current core. This means the following two statements are equivalent.</p>

      {% highlight clj %}
      (streams
        prn
        (with {:state "normal"} prn)
        prn)
      {% endhighlight %}

      {% highlight clj %}
      (streams prn)
      (streams (with {:state "normal"} prn))
      (streams prn)
      {% endhighlight %}

      <p>You can now starting adding stream statements to the configuration
      file to start processing your own events. For specific examples of common
      event processing tasks see the <a href="howto.html">howto guide</a>.</p>

      <h2>What next?</h2>

      <p>James Turnbull has written a <a
      href="http://kartar.net/2014/12/an-introduction-to-riemann/">beautiful
      introduction to Riemann</a> which takes you through the whole setup
      process and monitoring some basic services.</p>

      <p>Riemann comes with a standard config that listens on the local ipv4
      interface and indexes all events, but that's just the the start. You can
      learn a little more about <a href="/concepts.html">Riemann core
        concepts</a>, and use <code>etc/riemann.config</code> as a guide for
      your own configuration. When you're ready to run Riemann in production,
      check out <a
        href="/howto.html#changing-the-config">Changing the
        config</a> and <a
        href="/howto.html#putting-riemann-into-production">Putting
        Riemann into production</a>.</p>

      <p>Riemann's config is a Clojure program. A little bit of Clojure
      knowledge will help clear up where to use parentheses, how functions
      work, and how to write more advanced streams. I've written a concise
      guide for Clojure's <a

        types</a>, and <a
        href="http://aphyr.com/posts/303-clojure-from-the-ground-up-functions">functions</a>,
      which should equip you with all the fundamentals.</p>
