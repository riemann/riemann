      3.</p>

      <p>Arthur Gautier (baloo) added a stream to dump data to KairosDB.</p>

      <p><a href="http://showyou.com">Showyou</a>, my employer, gave me the
      infrastructure I needed Riemann for, and the chance to share it with
      the world.</p>

      <p>John Mullerleile (jrecursive) was deeply involved in talking
      through the concept and structure of Riemann, as well as advice
      around the JVM and profiling.</p>

      <p>C Scott Andreas (cscotta) and the <a
        href="http://boundary.com">Boundary</a> crew gave many helpful
      suggestions around the JVM, Maven, high_scale_lib, and profiling. Our
      conversations yielded many references, algorithms and ideas.</p>

      <p>Allen Rohner (arohner) on #clojure offered a logging configuration
      snippet.</p>

      <p>Ryan Grove and Sean Cribbs gave feedback on documentation and
      design.</p>

      <p>Reid Draper contributed a syntactic patch.</p>

      <p>Sam Newman (snewman) brought Riemann up to speed with Clojure
      1.3.</p>

      <p>Tyler Schuett offered graphic design advice.</p>

      <p>Gleicon wrote the Python client.</p>
