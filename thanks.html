      <h2>Contributors to the next release</h2>

      <p>Matt Blair added an emacs modeline to the riemann configs.</p>

      <p>Roman H (mindreframer) did a fantastic job cleaning up the dashboard's
      ruby code, improving configurability, and adding tests.</p>

      <p>Dave Cottlehuber (dch) added some extra states to the dashboard CSS.</p>

      <p>Sebastian Probst Eide wrote an Erlang client.</p>

      <p>Thomas Omans (eggsby) made sweeping improvements to riemann-dash,
      including timeseries charts, typo fixes, UI polish, adding pushState
      logic for workspaces, and more. He added a configuration option for the
      dashboard's json store, as well as pivotable grid views.</p>

      <p>Goblin added a ResMon adapter to riemann-tools.</p>

      <p>Camshaft wrote two node.js libraries: simple-riemann, a client, and
      riemann-response-time, an instrumentation middleware.</p>

      <p>Tim Shadel added a local hostname override to all riemann-tools.</p>

      <p>Bip Thelin added fallback to riak-admin for riemann-riak, and fixed
      a bug causing riemann-tools to report nil hosts when no --event host
      was specified.</p>

      <p>Amir Mohammad Saied wrote a Go client.</p>

      <p>Magnus Holm pointed out some problems with the howto.</p>

      <p>Aaron Feng wrote a howto post about working with the dashboard.</p>

      <p>Franck Cuny added basic memcached monitoring to riemann-tools, added
      a help popup to riemann-dash, a few keybindings, and documentation
      fixes.</p>

      <p>Peter Scott consolidated the different Netty executor pools and
      changed repl/start-server! to take a hashmap instead of flat kv
      pairs. He also helped fix a bug in graphite-server.</p>

      <p>Guilherme Manika (gmanika) tracked down a Netty bug causing Riemann to
      leak connections in CLOSE_WAIT, and pointed out a transient bug in
      streams/coalesce on master.</p>

      <p>Ben Black (b6n) added arbitrary key-value pairs to the protocol, ruby
      client, java client, and clojure client.</p>

      <p>Peter Scott fixed a method name in graphite-server.</p>

      <p>Dave Parfitt (metadave) wrote an OCaml client.</p>

      <p>richardg helped track down a bug in the Librato metrics name-escaping
      function.</p>

      <p>benmur fixed a nomethoderror on the dash.</p>

      <p>lwf added exception handling to the index reaper thread and added UDP
      support to the Graphite client. He also extended (delete-from-index) to
      delete classes of similar events, and helped with the riemann-java-client
      update, ensuring compatibility with Java 6.</p>

      <p>Rached Ben Mustapha wrote a Scala client.</p>

      <p>Tyler Schuett helped design Riemann's visual identity.</p>

      <p>Daniel Hilst wrote a C client.</p>

      <p>Miquel Ruiz wrote a Perl client.</p>

      <p>clee fixed some missing endquotes in the howto.</p>

      <p>dgtized fixed a typo in riemann-riak.</p>

      <p>Manos fixed a paren mismatch in the howto.</p>

      <p>Pierre-Yves Ritschard (pyr) formalized the protocol for riemann servers and
      split up the riemann.server namespace into distinct, modular transports. He
      suppressed the unnecessary close-channel logging messages from the TCP server.
      Pyr added streams/stream for composing streams together, and streams/split,
      split*, and splitp for branching conditionals. And riemann-puppet-ring. And
      riemann-mysql. As if that wasn't enough, he added debian package timestamps for snapshot builds. Jeez that guy's been busy! :D</p>

      full process args in cpu descriptions.</p>

      support.</p>

      Guaava futures.</p>

      <p>Pierre-Yves Ritschard improved (coalesce), cleaned up some code in
      riemann.common, added Travis-CI support, a Graphite-compatible server, and
      improved performance of pubsub. He added performance tests for the index.</p>

      Riemann-dash by fixing typos, adding 1.8 compatibility, and writing
      a puppet module.</p>

      <p>Edward Ribeiro refactored riemann-java-client's reporting and helped
      find bugs in riemann-java-client's rewrite.</p>

      tests.</p>

      <p>Paul Butcher fixed a typo in the quickstart.</p>
