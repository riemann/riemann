      riemann-tools, plus countless other commits. Rock on, man!</p>

      <p>Carl Yeksigian of Blue Mountain Capital published a C# client.</p>

      <p>Jake Luciani of Blue Mountain Capital contributed a Cassandra
      watcher.</p>

      <p>Ben Black contributed streams for fast reduction of events and metrics
      over time, experimented with integrating Parallel Colt, and suggested
      windowing API ideas.</p>

      <p>Gareth Rushgrove made it easier for folks to get started with
      Riemann-dash by fixing typos, adding 1.8 compatibility, and writing
      a puppet module.</p>

      <p>Edward Ribeiro refactored riemann-java-client's reporting and helped
      find bugs in riemann-java-client's rewrite.</p>

      <p>Derek Perez wrote a node.js client</p>

      <p>Joeseph Abrahamson, of Reify Health, wrote an Erlang client: Zeta.</p>

      <p>Joe Caswell added FreeBSD and Darwin support to riemann-health.</p>

      <p>Michael Klishin (antares) helped get Riemann's build process up to
      speed with Leiningen 2.</p>

      <h2>0.1.2</h2>

      <p>Michael Bernstein (mrb) got Riemann running on Clojure 1.4 and Lein2.</p>

      <p>Brian Shumate corrected a non-portable shebang line.</p>

      <p>Jeremy Carroll pointed out my evil lies in the configuration guide.</p>

      <h2>0.1.1</h2>

      <p>Michael Fairley added a hostname override to RiemannReporter.</p>

      <p>Edward Ribeiro improved concurrency in the Java client and fixed lots of
      little bugs, misphrasings, and typos.</p>

      <p> Tom Crayford pointed out a typo.</p>

      <p>Benjamin Anderson (banjiewen) wrote a new Python client.</p>

      <p>Steve Losh (sjl) wrote streams/fill-in-last and polished several rough
      edges in common, streams, and periodic. Steve also expanded the adjust
      stream to take a function which arbitrarily transforms entire events.</p>

      <p>Mårten Gustafson started work on the Java client, added timeouts, and
      tests.</p>

      <p>Paul Butcher fixed a typo in the quickstart.</p>

      <p>Obfuscurity and Lusis contributed ideas for HA failover and peer
      discovery.</p>

      <p>Lusis wrote an adapter between <a
        href="http://logstash.net/">logstash</a> and Riemann.</p>

      <p>Eric Lindvall (lindvall) updated riemann-ruby-client to be
      1.8-compatible.</p>

      <h2>0.1.0</h2>

      <p>#flatland, #clojure and #leiningen, including jodaro, ninjudd,
      raynes, and amalloy, helped with protobufs parsing, leiningen, and
      general Clojure questions.</p>

      <p><a href="http://showyou.com">Showyou</a>, my employer, gave me the
      infrastructure I needed Riemann for, and the chance to share it with
      the world.</p>

      <p>John Mullerleile (jrecursive) was deeply involved in talking
      through the concept and structure of Riemann, as well as advice
      around the JVM and profiling.</p>

      <p>C Scott Andreas (cscotta) and the <a
        href="http://boundary.com">Boundary</a> crew gave many helpful
      suggestions around the JVM, Maven, high_scale_lib, and profiling. Our
      conversations yielded many references, algorithms and ideas.</p>

      <p>Allen Rohner (arohner) on #clojure offered a logging configuration
      snippet.</p>

      <p>Ryan Grove and Sean Cribbs gave feedback on documentation and
      design.</p>

      <p>Reid Draper contributed a syntactic patch.</p>

      <p>Sam Newman (snewman) brought Riemann up to speed with Clojure
      1.3.</p>
