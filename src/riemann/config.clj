  Returns the service which will be used in the final core.

  This allows configuration to specify and use services in a way which can,
  where possible, re-use existing services without interruption--e.g., when
  reloading. For example, say you want to use a threadpool executor:

  ```clojure
  (let [executor (service! (ThreadPoolExecutor. 1 2 ...))]
    (where (service \"graphite\")
      (on executor
        graph)))
  ```

  If you reload this config, the *old* executor is busily processing messages
  from the old set of streams. When the new config evaluates (service! ...)
  it creates a new ThreadPoolExecutor and compares it to the existing core's
  services. If it's equivalent, service! will re-use the *existing*
  executor, which prevents having to shut down the old executor.

  But if you *change* the dynamics of the new executor somehow--maybe by
  adjusting a queue depth or max pool size--they won't compare as equivalent.
  When the core transitions, the old executor will be shut down, and the new
  one used to handle any further graphite events.

  Note: Yeah, this does duplicate some of the work done in core/transition!.
  No, I'm not really sure what to do about it. Maybe we need a named service
  registry so all lookups are dynamic. :-/"
