(ns riemann.deps
  "Riemann's dependency resolution system expresses stateful relationships
  between events. Dependencies are expressed as Rules; a Rule is a statement
  about the relationship between a particular event and the current state of
  the index.

  Maps are rules which specify that their keys and values should be present in
  some event in the index. {} will match any non-empty index. {:service \"a\"
  :state \"ok\"} will match an index which has {:service \"a\" :state \"ok\"
  :metric 123}, and so on.

  (all & rules) matches only if all rules match.

  (any & rules) matches if any of the rules match.

  (localhost & rules) states that all child rules must have the same host as
  the event of interest.

  (depends a & bs) means that if a matches the current event (and only the
  current event, not the full index), b must match the current event and index.
