(defn msteams
  "Posts events to Microsoft Teams using Incoming Webhook.
  Returns a function which is invoked with a URL and an optional formatter function
  and returns a stream. That stream is a function which takes an event or a
  sequence of events and sends them to Microsoft Teams.

  ```clojure
  (def msteams-output (msteams {:url \"https://outlook.office.com/webhook/abc/IncomingWebhook/xyz\")

  (rollup 5 60 msteams-output)
  ```

  Options:

  - :url Microsoft Teams Incoming Webhook URL
  - :formatter Optional message card formatting function, defaults to default-formatter

  The arity-2 version of the function accepts a map as the second argument which is
  passed directly to clj-http and can be used to set e.g. socket and connection timeouts.
