(defn pagerduty
  "Creates a PagerDuty adapter.
  By default, use the pagerduty v1 API. You can use the v2 API by setting the
  `:version` option to `:v2`.

  Returns a map of functions which trigger, acknowledge, and resolve events.

  General options:

  - `:service-key`         Pagerduty service key (also called integration key
  or routing key)
  - `:formatter`           Formatter for the pagerduty event. You can override
  the default formatter. The formatter must be a function that accepts an event
  and emits a hash. (optional)
  - `:options`             Extra HTTP options. (optional)
  - `:version`             set to `:v2` to use Pagerduty v2 API. (optional)

  v1 API:

  By default, event host and service will be used as the incident key. The PD
  description will be the host, service, state, and metric. The full event will be
  attached as the details.

  v2 API:

  By default, event host will be used as the source. The PD summary will be the
  host, service, state, and metric. The severity is the state. The full event will
  be attached as the details.

  Each event can also contains a `:dedup-key` key to handle alert de-duplication.

  Example, using the v1 API with a custom formatter:

  ```clojure
  (defn pd-format-event
    [event]
    {:incident_key 'Incident key', :description 'Incident Description',
     :details 'Incident details'})

  (let [pd (pagerduty { :service-key \"my-service-key\" :formatter pd-format-event})]
    (changed-state
      (where (state \"ok\") (:resolve pd))
      (where (state \"critical\") (:trigger pd))))
  ```"
  [config]
  {:trigger     (fn [e] (send-event :trigger config e))
   :acknowledge (fn [e] (send-event :acknowledge config e))
   :resolve     (fn [e] (send-event :resolve config e))})
